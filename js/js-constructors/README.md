JavaScript Constructors
=======================
This demonstrates how JavaScript objects can be used to structure methods, and how these methods may be attached to the DOM.

Usage
-----
Open up your Dev Tools and type a variable name followed by a method name. Example:

```javascript
red.resize(200, 200);
red.change_color(blue);
```

See `main.js` to determine which variable and method names are valid.
